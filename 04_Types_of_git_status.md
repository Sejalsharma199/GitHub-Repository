✅ 1. Untracked Files (Newfile)
Meaning: Files that Git doesn’t know about. You’ve created them, but haven’t added them to the repository yet.

What to do: Run git add file.txt to start tracking.

✅ 2. Modified Files (change)
Meaning: These are files Git is already tracking, and you've made changes, but haven’t staged them yet.

What to do: Use git add file.txt to move to staged.

✅ 3. Staged Files (Changes to be committed)
Meaning: Changes have been added using git add and are ready to be committed.

What to do: Use git commit -m "your message" to commit.

✅ 4. Unmodified (Clean)
Meaning: Nothing has changed in your working directory. Everything is clean and matches the last commit.

Status shown: nothing to commit, working tree clean


# ADD AND COMMIT 
Untracked / Modified --> staged --> commit

🔹 1. git add – Stage the changes
This tells Git to track the file or include it in the next commit (which is created in vs code)
bash : git add filename

✅ To add everything (all modified & new files):
bash : git add .

🔹 2. git commit – Save a snapshot
This creates a new commit with a message describing the changes.
bash : git commit -m "your message here"

🔹 3. Push to GitHub
Upload local repo content to remote repo , push the commits:
bash : git push origin main

✅ Step 1: Pull the latest changes from GitHub

This will bring GitHub's version to your local project without losing your local changes:

git pull origin main --rebase

✅ Step 2: Push your local changes to GitHub

Now, try pushing your change again:

git push origin main

✅ Step 3: Refresh GitHub page

After the push is successful, go to your GitHub repo in the browser and refresh the page — your change will be visible.


or 
🟢 Step 1: Add the remote GitHub repository URL again

In your terminal, run this:

git remote add origin https://github.com/sejalsharma199/GitHub-Repository.git

> 🔁 This tells Git: "When I push, push to this GitHub link."

🟢 Step 2: Push the changes now

git push origin main

Now your changes will go from your local system to GitHub successfully. ✅

💡 Tip to Check Remote Anytime

You can always check your remote URL with:

git remote -v

It should show the GitHub URL for both fetch and push.
