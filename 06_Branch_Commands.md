Why are branch commands used in Git?
Branches are used to:
1) Work on new features, fix bugs, or experiment without touching the main code (main)
2) Allow team collaboration — each developer can work on their own branch
3) Keep your main branch clean and stable

✅ 1. git branch
Purpose: List all local branches

✅ 2. git branch -M main
Purpose: Rename the current branch to main (commonly used after git init)
-M = forcefully move/rename

✅ 3. git checkout <branch-name>
Purpose: Switch to another branch

✅ 4. git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
Purpose: Create a new branch 

✅ 5. git branch -d <branch-name>
Purpose: Delete a branch (safely)

✅ 6. git push origin <branch
Purpose: is used to upload your local branch and its commits to the remote repository (usually GitHub).

Real-Life Example (Simple Workflow)
git branch                   # See all branches
git checkout -b feature-1    # Create and switch to new branch
# Do some work...
git add .
git commit -m "add feature 1"
git checkout main            # Go back to main branch
git merge feature-1          # Merge changes into main
git branch -d feature-1      # Delete branch after merging
