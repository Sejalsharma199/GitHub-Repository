âœ… CASE 2: Committed Changes â€“ Undo Last Commit (1 commit only)
You just committed, but you realize somethingâ€™s wrong.

git reset --soft HEAD~1
Uncommits but keeps your code in the staged state.

âœ… CASE 3: Undo Multiple Commits (go back N commits)
You made 3-4 bad commits. You want to go back to an older point.

git reset --hard<-commit hash-> (Hard- removes change from both vs code and git hub)
