 Way 1: Merge using Git commands

🔹 Step 1: Check the difference between two branches
Eg : git diff feature-login
(This compares the feature-login branch with your current one)

🔹 Step 2: Merge the branch into current one
Eg : git merge <branch-name>
(This applies the changes from <branch-name> into your current branch )

🔹 Step 3: Push the merged branch to GitHub
git push origin main

Way 2 : Merge using a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub

🔹 Step 1: Push your feature branch to GitHub
Eg : git push origin feature-login

🔹 Step 2: Go to GitHub → Your Repo
You’ll see a message:
✅ “Compare & pull request” — click it

🔹 Step 3: Create a Pull Request (PR)
a)Add a title & description
b)Choose:
Base branch: where you want to merge (e.g. main)
Compare branch: the one with your changes (e.g. feature-login)

🔹 Step 4: Review & Merge
Click “Merge Pull Request”
GitHub merges the code for you

🔹 Step 5: Pull Command
git pull orign main
(Since change is made is inside remote so to reflect it into local also )
